## subtledoctor install orders:

### EET WeiDU Log

I have started incorporating tipun's IWD mods into EET games - not to play the IWD campaigns from within BG, but to play modded IWD and IWD2 on an iPad. 

The 2022 install order is a bit jumbled... many mods are properly ordered compared to related ones, but not compared to unrelated ones. This looks chaotic but will generally not be harmful.

The 2023 order includes updated versions of many mods, and is radically re-ordered almost entirely by category. This should be much simpler to follow.

Note: if you use the base branch of Item Revisions, or IRR, then you need to move its later components forward in the order, before Faiths & Powers. If you use the SubtleDoctor updated branch, then it can be installed either before or after FnP, it doesn't matter.

Also: I have made personal modifications to several mods here: I changed the Drake, Tenya, and Rose BG1 mods to install into EET. And I changed several IWDEE quest and NPC mods to install on EET and be playable in the IWD campaign added by tipun. You cannot grab off-the-shelf versions of these mods and expect them to work, without some tinkering.
